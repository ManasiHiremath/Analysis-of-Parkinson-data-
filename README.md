Parkinson's disease data

Title: Parkinsons Disease Data Set

Abstract: Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset

Source:
The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in 
collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, 
Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the 
feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.


Attribute Information:

1. Matrix column entries (attributes):
2. name - ASCII subject name and recording number
3. MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency
4. MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
5. MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
6. MDVP:Jitter(%),MDVP:Jitter(Abs),MDVP:RAP,MDVP:PPQ,Jitter:DDP - Several 
7. measures of variation in fundamental frequency
8. MDVP:Shimmer,MDVP:Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,MDVP:APQ,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude
9. NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
10. status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy
11. RPDE,D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
12. DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent
13. spread1,spread2,PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation 
 
Objective:
Goal is to classify the patients into the respective labels using the attributes from their voice recordings
